# Mobile-Price-Classification

This project implements a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based feature selection method combined with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for classification tasks. The selected features are then used to train a custom Decision Tree Classifier.
**EVERY STEP IS IMPLEMETED FROM SCRATCH**
 
## Overview
The main objective of this project is to optimize feature selection using PSO and apply LDA for dimensionality reduction before training a custom Decision Tree Classifier. This approach helps improve the classification performance by selecting the most relevant features and reducing the data dimensionality.

### Key Steps
1. **Data Loading:** Load the training and testing datasets.
2. **Preprocessing:** Map target labels to binary values and compute statistical features.
3. **PSO Feature Selection:** Optimize feature selection using Particle Swarm Optimization.
4. **LDA Transformation:** Apply Linear Discriminant Analysis for dimensionality reduction.
5. **Training and Prediction:** Train the custom Decision Tree Classifier and make predictions.
6. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance.
